                    The question that has been asked before my many people who are looking to get into programming and the world of Software Development.
                    To keep it simple, backend is everything that you don't see when using a device. It controls the databases and stores all of your info, it
                    keeps track of all your passwords and your stored info. Backend Developers provide the function to any technological device you'll ever use.

                    <p>
                    The main purpose of a Backend Developer is to build and maintaining websites while ensuring the functionality of the webpage. Have you ever wondered
                    while scrolling through social media all of the posts and images you see are related to the content you enjoy most? This is done by a tool Backend Developers
                    use called 'Algorithms'. These algorithms collect data from different things such as how a user interacts with certain topics or their watch time on a certain video
                    and provides more content similar to those on your feed. Backend Development typically answers the question "How" when it comes to anything with a website,
                    if you were ever wondering 'How' the website was able to remember your passwords or 'How' the social media app knew which post to suggest next, backend development is 
                    what answers all of those questions
                    </p>
